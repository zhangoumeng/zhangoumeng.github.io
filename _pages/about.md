I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Biophotonics lab at the California Institute of Technology. I received my B.S. in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (2014) and my M.S. (2017) and Ph.D. (2022) in electrical engineering from Washington University in St. Louis. My research interests include single-molecule microscopy, computational imaging, and imaging system design.
