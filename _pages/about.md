I am a postdoctoral researcher in [the Biophotonics Lab](https://biophot.caltech.edu/) at the California Institute of Technology, under the supervision of Dr. Changhuei Yang. I received my B.S. in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (2014) and my M.S. (2017) and Ph.D. (2022) in electrical engineering from Washington University in St. Louis. During my graduate studies, I worked in [the Lew Lab](https://lewlab.wustl.edu/) and was advised by Dr. Matthew D. Lew. My research interests include single-molecule microscopy, computational imaging, and imaging system design.
